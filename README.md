# SMS_-spam_classification
## <h1><b1>Overview</b1></h1>

This repository contains code for a machine learning model designed to classify spam SMS messages. The model utilizes various machine learning algorithms, deep learning techniques, and data mining strategies to accurately identify spam messages, thereby contributing to communication security.

## <h1><b1>Features</b1></h1>

**ML Algorithms**: The model incorporates a range of machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees to effectively classify SMS messages.

**Deep Learning**: Deep learning techniques including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to capture intricate patterns in the text data for improved classification accuracy.

**Data Mining**: The repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and data augmentation to enhance the performance of the model.

**Evaluation Metrics**: Various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy are computed to assess the performance of the model.

## <h1><b1>Usage</b1><h1>
To get started with using the spam SMS classifier, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository**: git clone https://github.com/ps0821/spam-sms-classifier.git

**Install Dependencies**: pip install -r requirements.txt

**Prepare the Dataset**:
Ensure your SMS dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

Preprocess the data by removing any noise, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

**Train the Model**:
Use the provided scripts to train the model on your dataset.

Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to achieve the best results.

**Evaluate the Model**:
After training, evaluate the model's performance using various evaluation metrics.

Tune the model further based on the evaluation results if necessary.

**Deploy the Model (Optional)**:
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in your desired environment for real-world usage.
